<h2> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h2>

Hi!

My name is Guilherme, I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student with a solid 10-year background as a chemical engineer. Throughout this journey, I've always been driven by a constant impulse: solving problems creatively and effectively. This same passion—for understanding systems, proposing solutions, and implementing them—is what brought me closer to technology and, more recently, to programming.

Although my academic background is in chemical engineering, I’ve always been fascinated by logic and the creation of digital solutions. Since college, when I first encountered programming, I felt its potential—a bridge between structured thinking and creative construction. I took UX/UI Design courses at Awari and worked on a few personal projects focused on interface design, but I realized I had a much stronger desire to build what happens behind the scenes.

Today, I’m fully focused on transitioning into tech. I study daily with the support of the Full Stack Club community, where I’ve been diving deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Git, GitHub, databases, software architecture, and much more.

During my time as an engineer, I applied this problem-solving mindset in many ways. I improved processes, developed internal tools, and organized technical documentation with a focus on clarity, structure, and efficiency. I believe these skills will greatly contribute to my development as a programmer.

Currently, I'm working on personal projects to put all this knowledge into practice. I’ve built a fictional web application for space tourism (Mars - The Project), a functional calculator app, and I'm now developing a website for my fiancée’s atelier to help boost client acquisition and strengthen her brand. My current focus is front-end development, while also studying back-end technologies to become a well-rounded Full Stack developer—and maybe even dive into game development in the future.

Beyond technology, I’m passionate about books, games, series, and movies. I live with my fiancée, our daughter, and our cat Luke, who insists on joining every remote meeting.
If you’re looking for someone who’s passionate about tech, has a strong problem-solving mindset, and a thoughtful approach to building efficient, well-structured products—let’s connect.
